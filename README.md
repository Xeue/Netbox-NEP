This is the fork for NEP network automation and tracking, please see the netbox-community repo for more information!

NetBox is the leading solution for modeling and documenting modern networks. By
combining the traditional disciplines of IP address management (IPAM) and
datacenter infrastructure management (DCIM) with powerful APIs and extensions,
NetBox provides the ideal "source of truth" to power network automation.
Available as open source software under the Apache 2.0 license, NetBox serves
as the cornerstone for network automation in thousands of organizations.
